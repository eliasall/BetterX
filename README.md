## The Better eXperience Project

BetterX is a research project from the University of Central Lancashire partly sponsored by Amazon Web Services.  The aim of BetterX is to explore ways to measure, model and enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile web users in a practical manner applicable to real-world settings.

The first phase of BetterX is to collect live mobile user data and construct a predictive model which quantifies (or scores) the user-perceived experience of mobile web browsing sessions.  For that, three components were developed, the BetterX Android Application, the BetterX Cloud Setup and the BetterX Firefox Addon.

The BetterX Android app collects anonymous information about the mobile device, the network, the connection, and sensor readings from the user's surrounding environment.  The BetterX Firefox addon collects anonymous web browsing information and the BetterX Cloud is used as the processing hub of all the information that is collected and produces the Mobile Web Quality of Experience (MWQoE) model and the MWQoE metric on a 1-5 scale.

The first phase of BetterX has been completed and a proof-of-concept implementation of a Mobile-to-Cloud system which measures, predicts and attempts to enhance the Mobile Web Quality of Experience has been developed.  Moreover, the first version of the MWQoE model has been generated based on a live data collection from all over the world.  The MWQoE model has also been evaluated and benchmarked against actual user responses from a lab experiment in which selected web sessions which were observed in the live dataset have been simulated in a lab environment.

The BetterX project shows that the Mobile Web Quality of Experience evaluation and prediction in using a non-intrusive approach is possible and that the MWQoE model can be used in real-world scenarios to characterize the userâ€™s satisfiability in mobile web browsing.

Currently, the second phase of BetterX is being planned to implement enhancements on the generated model and improve accuracy.

Anyone interested in this project can download/modify/contribute to the source code that is made available and also use/analyze the published datasets given that proper attribution is given.

Publications and more information about BetterX will be posted here soon.


### Research Questions
1. What are the Design & Techical Considerations of an end-to-end system to measure and enhance the MWQoE in a non-instrusive manner?
2. What factors affect MWQoE and how do they affect it?
3. What are the real-world scenarios in which we can predict and enhance MWQoE with reasonable confidence?
